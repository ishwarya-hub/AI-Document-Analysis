## 📌 Problem Statement

> **"GUVI Hackathon 2026 challenges developers to build production-quality applications over an intensive sprint. Participants choose one of three engineering tracks and deliver a fully functional, hosted solution."**

### Background

Track: **AI-Powered Document Analysis & Extraction – API Endpoint Tester (Active)**

This endpoint tester allows participants to validate their API for the AI-Powered Document Analysis & Extraction. Participants can test authentication, request handling, document analyzing & extraction, and response structure by sending apikey to their deployed API endpoint before final evaluation. The request data will be sent from our side.

### The Core Problem

| Challenge | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| 🔴 **API Authentication Validation** | Ensuring headers with valid API keys are correctly authenticated |
| 🔴 **Multi-format Processing** | Receiving and processing `pdf`, `docx`, and `image` input accurately |
| 🔴 **Request Parsing** | Correctly handling and parsing complex Base64 encoded document payloads |
| 🔴 **JSON Formatting** | Maintaining a strictly structured JSON response for summarization and entities |
| 🔴 **Stability & Behavior** | Guaranteeing robust API stability during rigorous automated testing |

*Note: This tester is for validation purposes only. The final evaluation uses a separate automated system with official samples.*

---

## 💡 Solution & Approach

### Our Strategy

We designed a robust, full-stack endpoint tester combining a FastAPI backend and a React/Vite frontend. It acts as both a comprehensive processing engine and an interactive test harness:

1. **Dual functionality** — Serves as a reference implementation of the extraction logic *and* a GUI to test endpoints.
2. **Interactive UI (Endpoint Tester)** — A frontend to enter the deployed API URL, provide the API key, and trigger test payloads.
3. **AI Pipeline** — Integration with Google Gemini, spaCy NER, and DistilBERT for intelligent extraction.
4. **Asynchronous Architecture** — Uses Celery and Redis to process heavy document extraction tasks efficiently.

### Architecture Overview

```text
[Participant / User]
        ↓  Enters Endpoint URL & API Key
[React/Vite Frontend]
        ↓  Sends Test Payloads
[Deployed Participant API] <--- OR ---> [Local Reference API (FastAPI)]
                                                ↓
                                      [Celery Task Queue (Redis)]
                                                ↓
                                [AI Models: Gemini / spaCy / DistilBERT]
```

## 🎯 Objectives

- ✅ **Provide an Endpoint Tester UI** for participants to validate their APIs
- ✅ **Test API authentication** via header keys
- ✅ **Support multiple formats** (PDF, DOCX, Images)
- ✅ **Ensure correct JSON structures** for summaries, named entities, and sentiment
- ✅ **Establish a highly performant reference backend** using FastAPI and Celery
- ✅ **Foster open-source collaboration** by providing clear contribution guidelines

### Step-by-Step Operation

| Step | Action | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Configure Tester** | Enter your deployed API endpoint URL and providing the `x-api-key`. |
| 2 | **Trigger Request** | Click "Test Endpoint" to dispatch sample base64 payloads to your API. |
| 3 | **Authentication Check** | The target API validates the headers. Invalid keys must return HTTP 401. |
| 4 | **Extraction** | The API processes the payload, handling PDF, DOCX, or Image logic. |
| 5 | **AI Inference** | The API generates a summary, extracts entities (names, dates), and predicts sentiment. |
| 6 | **Validation** | The tester verifies the returned JSON structure matches the expected schema. |

## 💻 Code Analysis

### Main Architecture Decisions

#### Async Processing (`backend/tasks.py`)
```python
@celery_app.task(bind=True)
def process_document_task(self, document_data):
    # Offloads heavy AI and extraction tasks from the main thread
    # ensuring the FastAPI server remains highly responsive
    result = document_service.run_pipeline(document_data)
    return result
```

#### API Route Security (`backend/routes/analyze.py`)
```python
# Securing the API endpoint using a mandatory dependency
async def verify_api_key(x_api_key: str = Header(...)):
    if x_api_key != settings.expected_api_key:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=401, detail="Unauthorized")
```

### Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| **FastAPI + Uvicorn** | Selected for native async support, vital for I/O bound LLM network calls. |
| **Celery + Redis** | Prevents timeouts when processing large multi-page PDF documents. |
| **React + Vite** | Provides a blazing fast, hot-reloading frontend to build the Tester UI. |
| **Modular AI Tools** | Separating Gemini (Summarization), spaCy (NER), and HuggingFace (Sentiment) ensures the best tool is used for each specific task. |
